## Brand Identity

### Who Jorge Is
A growth strategist who embeds with small B2B tech firms to build their entire go-to-market system. Strategy, landing pages, automation, outreach — he does the thinking and the building.

### Brand Structure
- **GST** is the forward-facing brand name (working name — may change)
- **Jorge** is fully visible as the person behind it. First person voice throughout. "I", never "we."
- Think DesignJoy → Brett Williams. The brand is the wrapper; the person is the product.
- Legal entity handles contracts and invoicing. The site sells Jorge.

### Voice & Tone
- First person. Direct. Confident without being arrogant.
- Clinical but warm — not corporate, not bro-marketing.
- Short sentences. No fluff. Every line earns its place.
- Technical enough to earn respect from technical founders. Not marketing jargon.
- The tone should match the design: restrained, considered, unhurried.

### Positioning Statement (P2 — Identity-Led)
> "I'm a growth strategist who embeds with small B2B tech firms to build their entire go-to-market system. Strategy, landing pages, automation, outreach — I do the thinking and the building."

### Unfair Advantages
1. **Currently in the trenches** — Not an ex-marketer who advises. Building a real growth engine for a real B2B tech company right now.
2. **Full-stack execution** — Strategy + copy + design + web dev + automation + analytics. No handoffs, no gaps.
3. **Tech-native** — Understands the product landscape intrinsically. Speaks the buyer's language, not marketing jargon.

## Target Audience (ICP)

### Company Profile
- **Vertical:** B2B tech services — MSPs, cybersecurity firms, network solutions, cloud services, managed IT, niche ISPs
- **Size:** 3-20 staff
- **Revenue:** £100K-£1M, trying to break past £1M
- **Stage:** Have product-market fit. Solid product. Existing clients love them. Growth is the bottleneck.

### The Buyer
- Founder or MD. Technical background, not marketing-savvy.
- Making buying decisions alone or with 1-2 partners.
- Has been burned by agencies who didn't understand the product.
- Wants a partner, not an order-taker. Wants someone who gets it.
- Skeptical of "marketers" but knows they need help.

### What They're Feeling
- "We have a great product but nobody knows about us"
- "Our website was built by engineers and it shows"
- "We've tried agencies — they didn't get our product"
- "We know we need marketing but don't know where to start"
- "We can't afford a full marketing team"

## Case Study: Anonymised DA Story

> Use this as the proof narrative throughout the site. Names changed, story real.

**The Setup:**
A niche B2B connectivity company selling 5G Fixed Wireless Access to MSPs and corporate IT teams. Technical product, technical buyers, zero acquisition system. Growth was entirely word-of-mouth and referrals.

**The Problem:**
- Website built by engineers — functional but not converting
- No systematic lead generation
- No marketing automation or nurture sequences
- No outreach system — relied on inbound that wasn't coming
- Needed to pivot positioning (from events WiFi to corporate 5G/private networks)

**What Was Built:**
- Found product-market fit through positioning work
- Rebuilt landing pages for conversion
- Set up HubSpot automation — lead capture, nurture, scoring
- Built cold outreach system — email sequences, LinkedIn, SDR hand-off playbook
- Full funnel from awareness to qualified lead to sales hand-off
- Analytics and tracking to measure what's working

**The Result:**
A complete acquisition system running end-to-end. From scattered tactics to a working growth engine. One person did the strategy AND the building.

**Why It Matters for the Site:**
This story proves every claim in the offer doc. "I do the thinking and the building" — here's the proof. "I understand B2B tech" — I'm literally inside one right now.

## Site Structure — One-Pager

Single scrolling page. Ship fast, iterate later. Each section maps to a StoryBrand step.

### Section Flow

| # | Section | StoryBrand Step | Purpose |
|---|---------|----------------|---------|
| 1 | **Hero** | Character (the client) | Massive headline that names the problem. Not about Jorge — about the visitor. |
| 2 | **Problem** | Has a Problem | Expand the pain. "Your website was built by engineers. Your growth is word-of-mouth. You've been burned by agencies." |
| 3 | **Guide** | Meets a Guide | Introduce Jorge. Credentials through proof, not claims. The anonymised case study lives here or nearby. |
| 4 | **Case Study** | (Social Proof) | The DA story. Before → what was built → result. Visual, scannable. |
| 5 | **How It Works** | Gives a Plan | The 3 phases. Simple, numbered, clear. Removes complexity and fear. |
| 6 | **What You Get** | (Offer Detail) | Deliverables per phase. The "Agency vs Me" comparison table. |
| 7 | **Pricing** | Calls to Action | 3 options (Stark framework). Clear, transparent, no "contact for pricing." |
| 8 | **FAQ** | Avoid Failure | Handle objections. "Why up-front?" "What if my product is too niche?" "What happens after?" |
| 9 | **CTA / Contact** | Achieve Success | Book a discovery call. One clear action. Paint the after-state: "A growth engine running without you thinking about it." |

### Hero Section — Copy Direction

The hero should NOT lead with Jorge or GST. It leads with the visitor's problem.

**Direction (not final copy):**
> You have a great product.
> You have no acquisition system.
>
> I build the engine that turns strangers into qualified leads — strategy, landing pages, automation, outreach. End to end.

The headline should be massive serif type. The subtext should be small sans. Generous space. One CTA: "Book a Discovery Call" or "See How It Works" (scroll anchor).

### "Agency vs Me" Comparison (Section 6)

| They | I |
|------|---|
| Account manager relays your needs to a team | You talk to the person doing the work |
| Generic playbook applied to your niche | I understand B2B tech — I'm building one right now |
| Strategy OR execution | Strategy AND execution — thinking and building |
| Dozens of clients, divided attention | 2-3 clients max — you get real focus |
| Long contracts, slow timelines | Fixed scope, clear timelines, pause or stop anytime |

## Key Messaging Principles

1. **Client is the hero, Jorge is the guide.** The site talks about the visitor's problem first, Jorge's capabilities second.
2. **Show, don't claim.** The case study does the selling. Don't say "I'm an expert" — show the proof.
3. **Specificity over generality.** "B2B tech companies with 3-20 staff trying to break £1M" — not "businesses that want to grow."
4. **Name the fear.** "You've been burned by agencies before." "Your website was built by engineers." Call out what they're already thinking.
5. **Transparency builds trust.** Pricing on the page. Process steps visible. No hidden gates.
6. **One CTA throughout.** Every section ladders to the same action: book a discovery call.

## What This Doc Does NOT Cover

- **Visual design / technical implementation** → See `DESIGN-ETHOS.md`
- **Final copy** → This doc provides direction and structure. Final copywriting is a separate pass.
- **Brand name** → GST is a working name. Rename when ready; the strategy underneath doesn't change.
- **Blog / content** → Not in scope for the one-pager launch. Add later.
- **Legal (contracts, terms, privacy)** → Needed before going live but not a design concern.
